CSC205 Homework #3 Part 3

A rational number is a number that can be represented as the ratio of two integers.
For example, 2/3 is a rational number, 355/133 is a good approximation of PI 
and you can think of 7 as a rational number with an implicit 1 in the denominator (7/1).
For this assignment, you are going to write a class definition for rational numbers.
